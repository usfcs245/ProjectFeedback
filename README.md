# Project Feedback

The most updated version of this document can be found [here](https://github.com/usfcs245/ProjectFeedback "Project Feedback"). Always look at the most updated version if possible.

## Information

Feedback for your projects will be provided inline. This can be found in a new branch called **comments**. In the same row as the `Upload files` button. You should see `Branch: master` and `New pull request` on the left side. 

Click `Branch: master`. You should see a dropdown menu with two branches: `comments` and `master`. 

If you do not see the comments branch, it is likely because feedback has not been finished yet. If this is the case, wait for feedback to be completed or send a private message on Piazza if you are concerned. 

Otherwise, click the `comments` branch. Click your file(s) and you will find added comments used for feedback.

## Alternate Method

The method explained in *Information* is a very basic way to view your inline comments. However, there are a couple other ways that GitHub provides that makes viewing the feedback easier and more visually appealing. We will go over one of the ways.

Follow the same steps until you get to the `comments` branch. In the row below the `Upload files` button, the right side should say`Pull request` and `Compare`. Click `Compare`. This will give you a much better way to view feedback. The additions (feedback) will be marked in green an shown in a succinct manner and deletions will be marked in red. 

More information about viewing changes between commits can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/comparing-commits-across-time/ "Comparing commits across time").

## Final Thoughts

I recommend using the [alternate method](#alternate-method) and encourage you to look through the feedback and your code. It would also be useful to try improving your project. Although doing this will **not** regain any lost points, this is great practice and ensures that you fully understand for future projects and assignments. 

If you have any questions about the feedback given, send us message on Piazza or come to office hours and we will do our best to explain.
